  This is a guessing game created with rust ðŸ¦€.
</p>
<p>
  I created this project with the intention of practicing my skills with the Rust programming language. The game works very simply: it generates a random number using the "rand" crates, the program prompts the user for information and checks if it matches. If not, it repeats the process until there is a match.
  
  In this small program, I tested my knowledge of loops, variables, crates, imports and variable type conversions.
